Distance testing in nature
 - Tested distance with Line of sight 200m
 - Signal is a bit better in communication between ESP32 to ESP32 compared to using ESP 8266
 - Signal is influenced a lot of antena positioning
 - In forest 50 m seem to be a solid distance between ESP32s, but more is not really tested
 - Long range doesn't seem to do much when it comes to signal power

Powering the sensor
 - An BC 546 is used to power the moisture sensor. The sensor positive is connected to 3V3, and GND is connected to the collector of the transistor
 - D6 is connected through a 1k resistor to the base of the transistor and the GND of the ESP is connected to the emitor of the transistor


The sensor with the regulator removed soldered to one esp gives bigger range than the rest.This needs to be investigated
